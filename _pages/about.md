My background of medical systems engineering comes in handy in identifying the role of environments, brain structures and circuits involved in prosocial behavior, like helping and cooperation, in rodents. Inititally, I was very surprised to find out that rodents are capable of prosocial behaviors. My work involves using machine learning models and pose estimation to track and estimate rodent social behavior and how this behavior changes based on the environent they are in.Explain a little more about the project.
