I'm an medical systems engineer interested in understanding how different environments impact prosocial behavior, like helping and cooperation, in rodents. My work involves using machine learning models and pose estimation to track and classify rodent social behavior. I have also been working on finding the neural correlates related to helping behavior using brain imaging techniques to understand the regions involved in prosocial behavior. I am throughly enjoying working with, integrating and analysing different types of data ranging from brain imaging, i.e 1-photon imaging, to video recordings. Being a woman of color, social equity is very important to me. I also love art, writing, baking and yoga. I'm currently in the second year of my PhD and would love to do an indutry internship related to machine learning and computer vision.
